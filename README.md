# Pocket Forest

# Project brief

Our main goal is to help people get out and learn about trees. 
In this app, a user has the ability to find a tree which is in their location and capture it to add their collection. 
Later, users have the ability to gain points and level up in a leaderboard 
as well as interact with other users.

# Extra features:
